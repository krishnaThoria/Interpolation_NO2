# High-Resolution Air Pollution Mapping via Satellite Data Interpolation

This project presents a Python-based framework for downscaling low-resolution satellite imagery of Nitrogen Dioxide (**NO‚ÇÇ**) using spatial interpolation techniques. The workflow uses daily data from the **OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument)** satellite, upscales it to a high-resolution grid (5 km), and validates the results against the higher-resolution **TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument)** satellite.

The core of this repository is the `Interpolation.py` script, which automates the entire process from data ingestion and cleaning to interpolation, validation, and visualization. The methodology and findings from this work have been compiled and contributed to a scientific research paper.

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Pipeline:** Processes entire directories of OMI and TROPOMI files, matching them by date.
- **Multiple Interpolation Methods:** Implements and compares four different spatial interpolation algorithms:
  - Bilinear
  - Ordinary Kriging
  - Radial Basis Function (RBF)
  - Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)
- **Quantitative Validation:** Automatically calculates key performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, Bias, Correlation) by comparing interpolated results against TROPOMI as a ground truth.
- **Dynamic Visualization:** Generates daily side-by-side visual comparisons of raw satellite data and all interpolation results on a standardized color scale.
- **Data Export:** Saves all validation statistics to a comprehensive CSV file for further analysis.

## Methodology

The workflow for each day of data follows these steps:

### 1) Data Ingestion & Cleaning
- The script loads a low-resolution OMI L2 NO‚ÇÇ data file. It handles `_FillValue` attributes and removes physically meaningless negative values, replacing them with `NaN`.
- The corresponding high-resolution TROPOMI L2 NO‚ÇÇ file for the same date is loaded. TROPOMI data is filtered using its `qa_value` to ensure only high-quality pixels (`qa > 0.75`) are used for validation.

### 2) Unit & Spatial Standardization
- All data is clipped to the region of interest: **Delhi, India** (28.0¬∞‚Äì29.5¬∞ N, 76.5¬∞‚Äì78.0¬∞ E).
- TROPOMI data, originally in **mol/m¬≤**, is converted to **molecules/cm¬≤** to match the units of OMI data, ensuring a valid comparison.

### 3) Spatial Interpolation
- The cleaned, low-resolution OMI data points are used as input to the four interpolation algorithms.
- Each algorithm generates a high-resolution (**0.05¬∞ √ó 0.05¬∞**, approx. 5 km) grid of NO‚ÇÇ concentrations over the Delhi region.

### 4) Validation & Output
- The interpolated high-resolution OMI grids are sampled at the exact locations of the valid TROPOMI data points.
- Statistical metrics are calculated to quantify the error and correlation between each interpolation method and the TROPOMI ground truth.
- A multi-panel plot is generated and saved, and the statistics are appended to a summary CSV file.

## Results

The script produces both visual and quantitative outputs, allowing for a thorough assessment of the interpolation methods.

### Visual Comparison

The plots below show the results for two different days. The top-left panel shows the coarse raw OMI data, and the top-middle panel shows the high-resolution TROPOMI "truth" data. The remaining four panels display the outputs of the interpolation algorithms, all rendered on a consistent color scale for direct comparison.

- **January 3, 2024:** A day with a concentrated pollution hotspot.

- **January 2, 2024:** A day with more dispersed pollution.

### Quantitative Validation

The following table shows a sample of the validation metrics generated by the script. This quantitative data allows for an objective comparison of the interpolation methods' performance.
